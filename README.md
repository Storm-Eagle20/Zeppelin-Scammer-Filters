# Zeppelin-Scammer-Filters
A public regex filter for Discord scammers, mainly for use with a private bot. This repository is for transparency purposes only.

Feel free to use the regex code provided, however do note it may result in false positives. I make no guarantees the code will work, or is fully efficient. It can probably be refactored to a smaller form factor with identical results.

Written for ECMAScript.
